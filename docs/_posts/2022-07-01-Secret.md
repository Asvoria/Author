  <p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome! Shomin felt really grateful to have you around.
  This space is only for those who had purchased Shomin's Secret Corner Pass (A type of ERC721 Token).<br><br>
  Simply connect your Metamask Wallet to the site and you will be able to view the secret members only contents! This Corner is still WIP, since Shomin doubt that she ever will have any real fans exist at all! LOL! What you will get, are some exclussive in progress art works and updates.<br><br>
  Currently the Secret Corner only support 2 network: Binance Smart Chain and Harmony Shard 0 Mainnet. And the website only support Metamask Wallet. Both version of Secret Corner Pass costs (BNB: 0.0068, ONE: 200) about USD$2.50 not including gas fee.<br><br>
